NEWS file for DOSEMU
====================

This file contains a list of user visible changes in DOSEMU. For the
raw developer changelog please refer to ChangeLog.

Version 1.2.2 (2004-07-11)
=============
* Backported bitmap font support for xdosemu from the development code.
  These are used by default! If you want to use the X fonts you must
  explicitly set $_X_font="vga" or use "xmode -font vga" at the DOS
  prompt. $_X_bilin_filt=(on) may help for prettier fonts in full-screen
  mode and scaled windows.
* Backported via-Unicode translations for filenames on lredir'ed drives
  (from iso-8859x to cpxxx and so on).
* The hogtheshold code was reorganized to be able to pass through certain
  events quicker (such as loading a file in FreeDOS EDIT) even when you 
  have it set to "1".
* Fixed all new warnings with GCC 3.4.
* Fixed compilation problem with Fedora Core 2 headers.
* Added cp895 and bg-mik character set support.
* Many VGAEMU bugs were fixed, and bitmap fonts are much quicker.
* Allow "fast" i/o ports above 0x400 for kernels that support it
  (2.6.7-mm kernels only for now)
* Implemented VxD hooks for WinOS2: seems to solve all remaining problems with
  Win3.1(WinOS2): allows Alt-Tab and the timer.
* Some non-intrusive DPMI and DOS extender fixes.
* An automatic backtrace using GDB (output in ~/.dosemu/boot.log)
  is attempted when DOSEMU crashes.
* Serial code fixes.
* Corrected int15/ax=e801 for so $_xms > 64M is reported correctly by MEM.
* Fix NPTL issues when switching VC's on the console.
* Check /proc/net/ipx/route etc for kernel 2.6.x.
* Fixed read/write problem for files with negative file offsets on
  lredir'ed drives.
