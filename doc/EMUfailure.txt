1. Fundamental problems

   Programs that don't work under the MSDOS Emulator and probably won't
   ever work, because of fundamental problems. Some of these fundamental
   problems result in these programs not being runnable on
   Win3.x/Win95/WinNT in a Dosbox and under OS/2 either. These programs
   are characterized by using any of these features:
     _________________________________________________________________

1.1. Virtual Control Program Interface (VCPI)

   VCPI allows programs to run in ring 0. This is kernel mode in Linux
   and not sensible.

   Example: sim2181.exe from Analog Devices DSP Kit
     _________________________________________________________________

1.2. Programs using older Versions of the Pharlap Extender

   The Pharlap Extender in it's older versions needed ring 0 access too,
   so it can't me made working in the emulator.

   Example:Autocad Version 12c1 For DOS
     _________________________________________________________________

1.3. MSDOS enhanced mode Windows kernel krnl386.exe

   krnl386.exe needs Ring 0 access too.
     _________________________________________________________________

1.4. Windows programs using Win32s

   Win32s needs Ring 0 access too.
     _________________________________________________________________

1.5. Does my failing program belong to these groups?

   Check with "strings <program.exe> | less" if the program contains some
   of these keywords vcpi, pharlap and win32s. Newer Pharlap programs may
   work.
     _________________________________________________________________

1.6. Fundamental problem with the Linux kernel

   The PC Internal Timer (PIT) can be programmed to produce interrupts
   with frequencies up to almost 2MHz. Linux sets this to only 100Hz (2.6
   kernels can set it to 1KHz) and doesn't allow the software to change
   that. This limits the minimal interval between subsequent SIGALRM
   notifications for software that uses the setitimer(2) syscall. To
   emulate the PIT frequencies that are higher than the frequency Linux
   sets the PIT to, dosemu uses "interrupt bursts": on every SIGALRM
   reception dosemu triggers the timer interrupt as many times as
   necessary to compensate the gap since the previous SIGALRM reception.
   This allows to keep a precise timing but causes problems for some
   programs. When the timer interrupt handler is invoked more than once
   without letting the main thread to execute, some programs can lock up.
   The game "Cosmo" is one of those.

   Another problem is that due to the aforementioned low timer frequency
   dosemu is not able to properly emulate the timings for different
   emulated hardware. That also causes problems for some programs. Scream
   Tracker 3, for example, can lock up at startup because the interrupt
   from an emulated SB card can be triggered earlier than it should be in
   a real system.

   Possibly a workaround may be found in future DOSEMU versions.
     _________________________________________________________________

1.7. Fundamental problems with the CPU

   There are several defects in Intel's x86 CPUs that are causing
   problems for some software. Below is a description of the defects that
   are known to cause problems for software running under dosemu.
     _________________________________________________________________

1.7.1. Problem with the virtualization of the IF flag

   Intel's manual
   http://www.intel.com/design/intarch/techinfo/pentium/inout.htm says:

   " A procedure may use the POPF instruction to change the setting of
   the IF flag only if the CPL is less than or equal to the current IOPL.
   An attempt by a less privileged procedure to change the IF flag does
   not result in an exception; the IF flag simply remains unchanged. "

   The fact that the exception is not being generated, prevents dosemu
   from catching and properly simulating the POPF instruction executed in
   protected mode. That, in particular, means that the following code,
   executed in protected mode (not in v86 mode) under dosemu, will end up
   with interrupts disabled (IF cleared):

    sti
    pushf
    cli
    popf

   [ the interrupts are still disabled here ]

   This bug can only affect DPMI programs, as using DPMI is the only way
   to execute protected mode code under dosemu. Known programs that are
   affected are the games from ID software, namely Doom2 and Duke Nukem
   3D, but only when configured with sound. An optional work-around was
   added to dosemu, which just re-enables the interrupts if they were
   disabled for too long in protected mode. Additionally the address of
   the instruction that disabled the interrupts, is added to a black-list
   and this instruction is ignored for subsequent passes so that it can't
   disable the interrupts any more. This is potentially unsafe, but if
   the timeout is long enough, no harm was observed so far. The timeout
   is configured via the $_cli_timeout option, which is measured in a
   10ms timer ticks. Setting that option to 0 disables the workaround
   completely, making Doom2 unplayable with sound enabled.
     _________________________________________________________________

1.7.2. ESP register corruption

   Intel's x86 CPUs have a defect described here:
   http://www.intel.com/design/intarch/specupdt/27287402.PDF chapter
   "Specification Clarifications" section 4: "Use Of ESP In 16-Bit Code
   With 32-Bit Interrupt Handlers", which reads as follows:

   " ISSUE: When a 32-bit IRET is used to return to another privilege
   level, and the old level uses a 4G stack (D/B bit in the segment
   register = 1), while the new level uses a 64k stack (D/B bit = 0),
   then only the lower word of ESP is updated. The upper word remains
   unchanged. This is fine for pure 16-bit code, as well as pure 32-bit
   code. However, when 32-bit interrupt handlers are present, 16-bit code
   should avoid any dependence on the upper word of ESP. No changes are
   necessary in existing 16-bit code, since the only way to access ESP in
   USE16 segments is through the 32-bit address size prefix. "

   The corruption happens when the Linux kernel returns control to the
   dosemu process, while a 32-bit DPMI client that uses a 16-bit data
   segment for the stack is active. This is not the usual case, but
   unfortunately some 32-bit DPMI clients are actually using a 16-bit
   segment for the stack, and even the dos4gw extender behaves that way
   sometimes. Intel was contacted to comment on that issue, and their
   comment follows:

   " We understand your concern, but at this time we do not have anyone
   to look at this. This part has been out for nearly 20 years and all of
   the designers are currently working on new projects. We will make a
   note of this and see if somewhere down the road someone in software
   can take a look at this. "

   The reliable workaround on the dosemu side was not found, but there
   are some hopes that this can be worked around on the kernel's side.
   Programs that are known to be affected by this issue are:

     * Need For Speed 1 (demo version at least, when configured with
       sound)
     * Syndicate Wars (when used with dos4gw 0.8)
     * Open Cubic Player

   These programs are crashing shortly after startup, but this problem is
   difficult to detect reliably, so there may be many more programs that
   experience a random crashes due to this CPU bug.

   It appeared that it may be possible to work around this problem by
   using a different DOS extender with the programs that are using the
   dos4gw extender by default. The DOS32A extender at
   http://dos32a.sf.net, seems not to trigger the problem. It can be used
   as follows: DOS32A progname.exe (at the DOS prompt). CauseWay dos
   extender also seems to help.

   It may be possible in the future to work around this problem by using
   the CPU emulation. It is already possible to run dosemu under a CPU
   emulator called Qemu (http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/qemu), where
   this problem doesn't exist.

2. Known bugs

2.1. Things YOU may help changing

2.1.1. List of currently known bugs in Dosemu 1.2.0.

     * Some documentation is known to be well out of date.
     * Windows 3.1 will not run very well because for some reasons.
     * OPL3 FM is not implemented yet (but Midi, SB8 and SB16 work)
     * IPX doesn't play well with DPMI. You might be able to use the
       packet driver in combination with DOS TSR drivers such as LSL,
       PDETHER and IPXODI. See NOVELL-HOWTO.txt and README.txt for
       details.
     * Some database programs (Clipper, FoxPro) have problems with
       locking in certain configurations. smbfs doesn't support locking.
       $_full_file_locks=(on) may or may not help.
     * The direct text console (without graphics) may have the whole
       screen jumping one line up.
     * Console graphics (especially switching VCs) can be problematic
       with certain video cards, in particular in combination with fbdev
       graphical consoles.
     * DPMI interrupt handling may be unreliable.
     * Mortal Kombat 1 and 2 are not producing any sound for unknown
       reasons.
     * X-COM Apocalypse locks up at startup if configured with sound.
     * RTC periodic interrupts are not implemented yet.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.1.2. Bug reports that are currently open at http://www.dosemu.org/. but
that were not yet confirmed by dosemu developers.

     * An (unknown) DPMI clipper program hangs when run on a SMP machine
     * A chess program (VChess) may crash in xdosemu when the mouse is
       moved (there are still some issues with the internal mouse driver)
     * Another chess program (Nimzo 3) crashes when there is no CD in the
       CDROM drive.
     * Watcom C may fail freeze on AMD but not PIV.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.2. Problems probably solved

   Here reported problems with older versions are listed. The current
   version should have solved them, but this has to be validated. Please
   report if you had problems in the listed areas and these problems are
   now solved.

     * There are known problems with xdosemu (e.g. it may not work at all
       for you.)
     * xdosemu sessions accessed from remote, non-Linux X-sessions (e.g.
       SUN stations and others) may not work correctly. Use
       $_mitshm=(off).
     * The internal mouse driver is known to have problems.
     * Running a protected mode 'make' and a protected mode compiler
       (e.g. Borland's) may not work. Try switching to a real mode make.
     * dd2demo.exe
       This is a game found at

    http://www.psygnosis.com/

       Reported by Hans Lermen, it kills dosemu, giving an output like:

    general protection at 0x1fba: a7
    ERROR: SIGSEGV, protected insn...exiting!

       The crash happens in DMPI Call 0x0302 At least DMPI Call 0x0506 is
       not yet implemented.
       This demo is no longer for download. But if you can test please
       let us know for completeness.
     * bae.exe
       This is a demo version of an Electronic CAD programm, found at

    http://www.bartels.de/

       Reported by Uwe Bonnes, it stops dosemu with a blank screen in an
       unusable state. You have to do a remote login to kill dosemu, or
       hit reset with all it's possible fatal result. The possible reason
       is the missing implementation of DMPI Call 0x0800, as Uwe Bonnes
       reported it once working on the console with some hack.
       However, this demo is no longer for download, and, moreover, they
       have a native Linux version.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.3. QIC tape programs

   Reported by vignani@mail.tin.it (Alberto Vignani): Tape is not
   supported. Worse, if you use a floppy under dosemu, you have sometimes
   to remove/reinstall the ftape module.
     _________________________________________________________________

3. Programs exhibiting graphical problems in xdosemu

   The following programs work perfectly on the Linux console
   (suid/sudo/root) with graphics enabled but exhibit minor or major
   glitches in xdosemu.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.1. Text programs with custom fonts

   Programs such as Norton Commander and the Watcom Debugger use custom
   characters to display icons, radio buttons and similar characters.
   This problem is addressed in current development versions and the
   fixes will likely be backported to a later version of DOSEMU 1.2.x
     _________________________________________________________________

3.2. Games with graphical problems

   The following games exhibit glitches or don't work at all in xdosemu.
   Please let us know when any problems are solved or even better, help
   us solving!

     * Commander Keen 1 wobbles like jelly and the window shakes every
       time it scrolls.
     * Commander Keen 4 gives you a black screen.
     * Clyde's Adventures statsbar fonts completely garbled xdosemu.
       Download at: http://www.gamesdomain.com/directd/513.html
     * Pinball Dreams 2 takes a long time to start. Once it's past the
       startup screen it runs fine though.
