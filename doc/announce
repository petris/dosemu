ANNOUNCEMENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The DOSEMU team is proud to announce DOSEMU 1.2.0,
the PC Emulator for x86 based *nix.

WHAT IS DOSEMU?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DOSEMU is a PC Emulator application that allows Linux to run a DOS
operating system in a virtual x86 machine. This allows you to run
many DOS applications. These are the capabilities of DOSEMU that are
worth noting:

  - Color text and full keyboard emulation (via hotkeys) even on terminal.
  - Built-in X-Windows support (includes IBM character set font)
    including fullscreen X (via Ctrl-Alt-F)
  - Graphics capability at the console (most compatible video cards).
    (requires suid-root or sudo)
  - Graphics emulation in X for many color modes.
    (X-server may be in true color mode)
  - DPMI support
  - Runs several 32-bit DPMI-compliant video games (including those based
    on DOS/4GW) at the Linux console (suid-root) and on X (non-suid).
  - integrated (command line) instruction level debugger, various break
    points, single stepping etc.
  - integrated EMS and XMS drivers
  - integrated packet driver
  - integrated mouse driver
  - integrated joystick driver
  - CDROM support.
  - ASPI driver support (CD writers, scanners, tapes etc.)
    (requires access rigths to /dev/sgX)
  - support for redirected drives (any Linux directory can be 'mounted'
    as DOS drive via the lredir command)
  - can even directly boot from a Linux directory containing all DOS files.
  - Sound support (including sound DMA and Midi)
  - NetWare and other network connectivity via builtin IPX and pktdrvr
     support.
  - dosemu-freedos packaged binary distribution installs directly via a
    normal user's $HOME and runs 'out-of-the-box' without any further
    configuration (no root rights needed).



REQUIREMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Linux >= 2.0.30 (with IPC support, IPX support optional)
  - any DOS to boot (FreeDos is contained in the dosemu-freedos-*-bin.tgz
    tarball and in the RPM)

When compiling dosemu yourself:
  - GCC 2.91.66+ and glibc 2.1.3+ are required.
  - binutils > 2.9.1.0.25
  - bison, _not_ yacc, and flex.

  ... and others too important to mention.

Of course, all those people involved in the FreeDos development should be
mentioned here too, but before I fail to mention some of them, I better point
you to http://www.freedos.org ;-)


WHERE TO GET IT:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The DOSEMU PC Emulator can be downloaded from the following FTP sites:

  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=49784
  ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/emulators/dosemu/

The binary distribution is dynamically linked against glibc-2.2 and libX*
from XFree86. It should run on all recent Linux distributions.
