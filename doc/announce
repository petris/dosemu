ANNOUNCEMENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The DOSEMU team is proud to announce DOSEMU 1.2.0,
the PC Emulator for x86 based Linux.

WHAT IS DOSEMU?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DOSEMU is a PC Emulator application that allows Linux to run a DOS
operating system in a virtual x86 machine. This allows you to run
many DOS applications. These are the capabilities of DOSEMU that are
worth noting:

  - color text and full keyboard emulation (via hotkeys) even on a terminal
  - built-in X-Windows support (includes IBM character set font)
    including fullscreen X (via Ctrl-Alt-F)
  - graphics capability at the console (for most compatible video cards)
    (requires suid-root or sudo)
  - graphics emulation in X for many color modes
    (X-server may be in true color mode)
  - DPMI support
  - runs several 32-bit DPMI-compliant video games (including those based
    on DOS/4GW) at the Linux console (suid-root) and on X (non-suid)
  - integrated (command line) instruction level debugger, various break
    points, single stepping etc.
  - integrated EMS and XMS drivers
  - integrated packet driver
  - integrated mouse driver
  - integrated joystick driver
  - CDROM support
  - ASPI driver support (CD writers, scanners, tapes etc.)
    (requires access rights to /dev/sgX)
  - support for redirected drives (any Linux directory can be 'mounted'
    as DOS drive via the lredir command)
  - can even directly boot from a Linux directory containing all DOS files
  - sound support (including sound DMA and Midi)
  - NetWare and other network connectivity via built-in IPX and pktdrvr
    support
  - the dosemu-freedos binary package starts a DOS-"C:\>"-Drive
    'out-of-the-box' in a normal user's $HOME directory and runs without 
    any further configuration (no root rights needed)

WHAT IS NEW against version 1.0.2.1?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Many bugs have been fixed.
- Easier configuration and installation from source code.
- Much improved DPMI support.
- Unicode support: translates between many different codepages and 
  character sets for keyboards, terminals and copy & paste in X.
- Much improved sound support, including SoundBlaster 16 and
  Midi emulation (but no OPL3 FM / Adlib yet).
- Improved VGA emulation in X.
- Fullscreen support in X using the Ctrl-Alt-F hotkey.
- Console improvements: by avoiding POST more graphics cards can
  be accessed directly in the "plainvga" mode. Raw keyboard support
  now also works without special privileges.
- Many improvements to the networking code (TUN/TAP).
- Improved PIC (Programmable Interrupt Controller) emulation.
- Joystick support.
- xterm mouse support (including PUTTY).
- DOSEMU shows the running DOS program in X and xterm title bars.
- Better terminal support (more keys are recognized).
- Improved I/O performance using asynchronous I/O.
- Added large file support for file locking.
- Security:
  * DPMI in suid-root DOSEMU is no longer inherently insecure; DOSEMU
    now drops its root priviliges after initializing; a forked off
    "I/O port server" (if necessary) allows access to the specified
    I/O ports where the main DOSEMU is not capable.
  * DOSEMU can be run via sudo in the same way as suid-root (it will 
    revert to the identity of the original user) -- therefore it is
    no longer necessary to install two seperate DOSEMUs (one suid-root
    and one non-suid-root copy) for security. One non-suid-root copy is
    all you need if you use sudo.
    As a side-effect dosemu.users is no longer necessary; without a 
    dosemu.users file DOSEMU will only use its root privileges if it is 
    run on the Linux console.
  * Partition access, mouse access (console only) and serial access
    are no longer automatically accomplished using root privileges
    but must be regulated via permissions on the relevant /dev/xxx
    devices.
  * Note that, as before, root permissions are in general not
    necessary if DOSEMU is run in a terminal or in X.

REQUIREMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Linux >= 2.0.30 (with IPC support, IPX support optional)
  - a DOS as guest-OS, which can be booted by DOSEMU
    (FreeDOS is included in the RPM or can be downloaded as
    dosemu-freedos-*-bin.tgz)

When compiling DOSEMU yourself:
  - GCC 2.91.66 or higher and glibc 2.1.3 or higher are required
  - binutils > 2.9.1.0.25
  - bison, _not_ yacc, and flex

  ... and others too important to mention.

Of course, all those people involved in the FreeDOS development should be
mentioned here too, but before I fail to mention some of them, I better point
to http://www.freedos.org ;-)


WHERE TO GET IT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The DOSEMU PC Emulator can be downloaded at:

  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=49784

The binary package is dynamically linked against glibc-2.2 and libX*
from XFree86. It should run on all recent Linux distributions.
