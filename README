DOSEMU is a user-level program which uses certain special features
of the Linux kernel and the 80386 processor to run MS-DOS/FreeDOS/
DR-DOS in what we in the biz call a `DOS box.'

You may freely use, modify and redistribute it under the terms
of the GNU General Public License, version 2; for details see
the file "COPYING".

Please refer to the NEWS file to read about recent user-visible
changes.

How to set up DOSEMU:
* Installation from source:
  please refer to the file INSTALL
* Installation of the ready to use binary distribution (stable versions only):
  please refer to the file README.bindist

Something's not right!!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Read your dosemu.conf file carefully and make corrections.

- Try disabling certain features.  On the linux console, the video options 
  and some of the rawkeyboard options sometimes cause problems.

- Read all documentation files carefully, and try to get some help from
  others who have used DOSEMU.

- Read the dosemu-HOWTO for Q&A's.

- If no luck, please send us a debug report by typing 'dosemu -D+a -o debug'
  and send the file debug together with your config files and a
  description of your problem to the SF bug tracking system that you can
  reach from

    http://www.dosemu.org

  Don't forget to mention the versions of DOSEMU, GCC, LIBC, Binutils etc.
  For problems with the packaging of DOSEMU by Linux distributors,
  please bother them directly - we won't hunt after those bugs.

  For general discussion on dosemu use the mailing list
  linux-msdos@vger.kernel.org

- Please be patient with us.  We get flooded with bug reports and do our
  best to respond in a timely fashion.

Available documentation -- mostly somewhat outdated :(
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can just execute ./ViewDocs to read the docs.
