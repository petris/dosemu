.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dosemu
is the wrapper script for
.B dosemu.bin
(1)
which invokes the Linux dos emulator, also known as
.BR DOSEMU .
The wrapper also takes care of (eventually) installing the private instance of
.BR DOSEMU
in the user's $HOME, if this doesn't exist.
.br

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I args
any number of options described in
.BR dosemu.bin
(1), please refer to this man page for further details.
However, take care to quote and escape correctly so bash doesn't
mess up arguments containing blanks and backslashes.
.TP
.I -dumb
use `dumb' terminal mode. This will only work for DOS applications, which do
plain text output to stdout, but has the advantage that (A) the output of
the DOS application stacks up in your xterm scroll buffer and (B) you can
redirect it to a file such as
.TP
		$ dosemu -dumb dir > listing

Note that DOSEMU command.com's commandline editor/history will also work
here, however, editing is restricted to BACKSPACE'ing.
.TP
.I -quiet
do not print startup comment and do not stop for prompting
.TP
.I -input
Do simulated keystrokes as given by
.I keystroke-string
just after DOS has booted. This can be used to autolaunch applications,
bypass any needed boot menus or something similar. For details on the format
of the string look at README.txt. Note, however, that the FreeDos kernel
eats one keystroke at bootup in order to let you time to type in F8. So in
this case you always should add a '\\r' at the beginning of this
keystroke-string. As a side effect it will bypass the 'F8' delay and
FreeDos will boot faster. Without "-input", a '\\r' is automatically
passed.
.TP
.I -s
Invoke dosemu via sudo. This is necessary to get access to certain I/O ports
and to get graphics on the Linux console. Please refer to the documentation
(INSTALL and README.txt) to see which files need to be adjusted before
attempting this. 
.TP
.I -install [ bootdir ]
launched as part of a systemwide installation, this option (re-)installs
a DOS that is used in DOSEMU (this can be the DOSEMU distributed
FreeDOS  or any proprietary DOS, which is bootable via fatfs).
.I bootdir
is the base name of a directory. The symbolic link ~/.dosemu/drives/c
will be changed to point to this directory.
Re-installing is only rarely necessary, since in practise the symbolic
link(s) will automatically point to updated files.

.SH AUTHOR
.B DOSEMU
(comprised of the files
.B dosemu.bin
and 
.B dosemu
) is based on version 0.4 of the original program written by Matthias Lautner
(no current address that I know of).
.PP
Robert Sanders <gt8134b@prism.gatech.edu> was maintaining and enhancing 
the incarnation of 
.B DOSEMU 
with which this man page was originally distributed. During about 4 years
James B. MacLean <macleajb@ednet.ns.ca> was the restless leader of the
dosemu team, implementation of DPMI (which made Windows-3.1, dos4gw, djgpp,
e.t.c running) happened during his 'governement' and brought the project
near to Beta-state. Hans Lermen <lermen@fgan.de> took over and released the
first 1.0 version. Now Bart Oldeman <bart@dosemu.org> is maintaining this
funny software.
